    <h2>Atomicity</h2>
        The term atomicity defines that the data remains atomic.<br/>
        It means if any operation is performed on the data, either it should be performed or executed completely or should not be executed at all. <br/>
        It further means that the operation should not break in between or execute partially.<br/>
        In the case of executing operations on the transaction, the operation should be completely executed and not partially.
