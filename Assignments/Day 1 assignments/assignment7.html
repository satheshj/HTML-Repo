        <h1>ACID properties</h1>
        DBMS is the management of data that should remain integrated when any changes are done in it. 
        It is because if the integrity of the data is affected, whole data will get disturbed and corrupted. 
        Therefore, to maintain the integrity of the data, there are four properties described in the database management system, which are known as the ACID properties. 
        The ACID properties are meant for the transaction that goes through a different group of tasks, and there we come to see the role of the ACID properties.

        <h2>Atomicity</h2>
        The term atomicity defines that the data remains atomic.<br/>
        It means if any operation is performed on the data, either it should be performed or executed completely or should not be executed at all. <br/>
        It further means that the operation should not break in between or execute partially.<br/>
        In the case of executing operations on the transaction, the operation should be completely executed and not partially.
