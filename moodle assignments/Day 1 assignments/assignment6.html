        DBMS is the management of data that should remain integrated when any changes are done in it. 
        It is because if the integrity of the data is affected, whole data will get disturbed and corrupted. 
        Therefore, to maintain the integrity of the data, there are four properties described in the database management system, which are known as the ACID properties. 
        The ACID properties are meant for the transaction that goes through a different group of tasks, and there we come to see the role of the ACID properties.
